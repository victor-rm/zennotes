/**
 * Per-note-tab scroll memory.
 *
 * The pane reuses a single editor + preview surface and renders only the
 * active tab's content, so switching tabs (or opening a diagram in a tab and
 * coming back) otherwise snaps a note to the top. This is a small imperative
 * cache — keyed by note path — that remembers each tab's editor selection
 * and preview/editor scroll offsets so re-activating the tab can restore its
 * position.
 *
 * It's intentionally a module-level cache, not store state: nothing renders
 * from it, it's read/written imperatively during tab switches and scrolls,
 * and it should never trigger React updates. Entries are capped with simple
 * LRU eviction so long sessions don't grow it without bound.
